# Fibonacci Algorithms

## Add Your Name Here

## Program Output

### Use eight fenced code blocks to provide output from eight different runs of `fibonaccicreator` with different inputs

TODO: Provide the output for running `iterativetuple` with a large and small input
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested output

TODO: Provide the output for running `iterativelist` with a large and small input
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested output

TODO: Provide the output for running `recursivetuple` with a large and small input
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested output

TODO: Provide the output for running `recursivelist` with a large and small input
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested output

TODO: If an algorithm does not work correctly and you can explain why it does not
work, then please provide that output in one of the above fenced code blocks

TODO: Whenever possible, please use the same "small" and "large" inputs for both
the List-based and Tuple-based algorithms.

TODO: Use the `--pyinstrument` command-line argument to open up a web-based display
of the call profile from running your program. You can use this output to understand
the other profiling information that `fibonaccicreator` can produce.

TODO: Do not run the program with the `--display` option when conducting
experiments!

TODO: Document and justify your choice for the `number` parameter.

#### Two outputs from running the `iterativetuple`

TODO: Provide a fenced code block with the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `iterativelist`

TODO: Provide a fenced code block with the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `recursivetuple`

TODO: Provide a fenced code block with the requested outputs

#### Two outputs from running the `recursivelist`

TODO: Provide a fenced code block with the requested outputs

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide five paragraphs that explain which algorithm is fastest, by how
much it is faster, and how you knew that it was faster, referencing the data
in the aforementioned command outputs to support your response. You should make
sure that you answer the following research questions:

- RQ: Is `fibonaccicreator` faster with a list or a tuple?
- RQ: Is `fibonaccicreator` faster with recursion or iteration?
- RQ: Overall, what is the fastest approach when using `fibonaccicreator`?
- RQ: Overall, what is the most memory efficient approach when using `fibonaccicreator`?
- RQ: Overall, what are inappropriate approaches for computing Fibonacci numbers?

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms are faster!
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm is faster!
TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain algorithms use less memory!
TODO: It is not sufficient to only explain WHICH algorithm algorithm uses less memory!
TODO: Make sure that you explain why certain algorithms are not suitable!

## Source Code

#### A function signature that defines the command-line interface for `fibonaccicreator`

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested source code
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the request source code
TODO: Explain each of the command-line arguments for this program

#### A code segment that calls a function based on its name in a string

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested source code
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the request source code
TODO: Explain exactly how Python can call a function using a string
