### Experiment Report

*Whenever possible, please use the same "small" and "large" inputs for both the List-based and Tuple-based algorithms.*

*Do not run the program with the `--display` option when conducting experiments!*

*If an algorithm does not work correctly and you can explain why it does not work, then please provide that output in one of the above fenced code blocks.*

//TODO// Preface: how many runs, the two types of data, inputs and why, sections not working.

## Professional Development

### What was the greatest challenge that you faced when completing this assignment?

The greatest challenge with this assignment was figuring out how to make it compatible with my Windows machine.  // TODO //

### Leveraging your response to the previous question, how did you overcome the challenge?

I overcame this challenge by doing a couple things. First, I spent time looking through online resources and documentation of how to use a docker container. I then connected with my colleagues to try to resolve the issue. Finally, I scheduled office hours to get a fuller understanding and direction of how to conduct the experiment locally through docker. After regaining confidence in my code, I distributed this knowledge to my colleagues. 

### Leveraging what you know from all experiments conducted this semester, what are fast ways to perform computations?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words. //List, single for loop, recursive or iterative? //

### Leveraging what you know from all experiments conducted this semester, what are slow ways to perform computations?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words. // Tuple, double-for-loops, recursive or iterative //
