### Experiment Report

*Whenever possible, please use the same "small" and "large" inputs for both the List-based and Tuple-based algorithms.*

*Do not run the program with the `--display` option when conducting experiments!*

*If an algorithm does not work correctly and you can explain why it does not work, then please provide that output in one of the above fenced code blocks.*

This experiment features the comparison of list and tuples as well as the iterative and recursive methods. After running each command four times, below are each of the experiment trials. Each trial has three outputs of the estimated overall memory, estimated peak memory, and estimated execution time according to the simple timer. 

The inputs chosen are paired for the iterative algorithms and then the recursive algorithms. The small input for the iterative functions is 10000 and the large input is 50000. The recursive functions had a small input of 385 and a large input of 985. The recursive has a different set of inputs since there is a limit to how many times a machine do the recursion. The limit is around 1000 for this machine I am working with so I chose the largest integer I could without receiving a stack error. 

As seen below, the simple timer was not precise enough to record the execution time some of the recursive algorithms. Ideally, pyinstrument in the browser should have been run with this experiment but was not functioning properly at the time of this experiment. With future experimentation, timing percision will be an area to improve on. 

In the next section, the outputs displayed in the fenced code blocks are the first runs of each input and algorithm combination.

## Performance Analysis

From the data collect above, I conclude that the list is faster than the tuple. With both methods (recursive and iterative), the list as the data container was faster. The difference of memory is less than 1 megabyte for both inputs and for peak and overall memory size. Execution times are drastically different between the two. For the small input, the list was 96.7% faster than the tuple and with the large inputs the list was 99.5% faster than the tuple.

Iterative seems faster than recursive. I am unable to draw  Though I was unable to compare directly between the recursive and iterative algorithms, the recursive seemed to be quick. This experiment will need to be conducted with a different machine. This cannot be confirma as the numbers 

The most efficient is the combination of the iteration method and list data container.

One difficulty with recursion, is that their is a limitation (depending on the machine's ability) to the amount of recursion a machine can handle. This is something to consider along with deciding if an algorithm is not suitable.

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how the completed source code works

#### A function signature that defines the command-line interface for `fibonaccicreator`

```
@cli.command()
def fibonaccicreator(
    approach: str = typer.Option(...),
    number: int = typer.Option(...),
    display: bool = typer.Option(False, "--display"),
    pyinstrument: bool = typer.Option(False, "--pyinstrument"),
):
```

This section of code is the function signature of the function called fibonaccicreator which works with the CLI. This function takes input from the CLI. The inputs are the approach, number, display, and pyinstrument. The approach is a string that needs to match the last part of the function names in the fibonacci.py file. The number is an integer. The approach and number are set as `...` as the default. The display is a boolean set as False unless it takes in `--display` from the keyboard input. The pyinstrument works similarly to display as it is also set as False unless `--pyinstrument` is inputed. 

#### A code segment that calls a function based on its name in a string

```
    # construct the full name of the function to call
    function = FIBONACCI_FUNCTION_BASE + UNDERSCORE + approach
    # construct the requested function from the compute module
    # Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3061/calling-a-function-of-a-module-by-using-its-name-a-string
    function_to_call = getattr(fibonacci, function)
```

This section of code features the part of the fibonaccicreator function that works to call the function. I included the line before it where the string `function` is constructed. This string is made of the global variables `FIBONACCI_FUNCTION_BASE` and `UNDERSCORE` and the input `approach`. This then producees the string of `fibonacci_iterativelist` if the approach input is `iterativelist`. This formats the string to match the functions in the fibonacci.py file. The next line featuring the getattr command. This takes the file name and the string of the function it is looking to call which is then stored in the variable `function_to_call`. This allows us to call functions from another file.

## Professional Development

### What was the greatest challenge that you faced when completing this assignment?

The greatest challenge with this assignment was figuring out how to make it compatible with my Windows machine. I spend a lot of time struggling to understand how docker containers work. I struggling to make it work for my purposes. 

### Leveraging your response to the previous question, how did you overcome the challenge?

I overcame this challenge by doing a couple things. First, I spent time looking through online resources and documentation of how to use a docker container. I then connected with my colleagues to try to resolve the issue. Then, I scheduled office hours to get a fuller understanding and direction of how to conduct the experiment locally through docker. Finally, I just ended up spending time reading documentation and bouncing ideas off of anyone who would listen. I finally found a solution to working with a docker container on my machine though it may only be a work around. After regaining confidence in my code, I distributed this knowledge to my colleagues. 

### Leveraging what you know from all experiments conducted this semester, what are fast ways to perform computations?

From all the experiments we have conducted so far, there are multiple pieces that effect the speed of computations. The fastest data container seems to be the list (at least in comparison to a tuple). This makes sense as lists are mutable and tuple are not. The single-for loop is faster than a double-for loop as seen in the last experiment. This makes sense since the double requires more iterations than a single-for loop. Iterative seems to be faster than recursive process. This makes sense as iterative does not call itself and works through specified range rather than continually calling itself and working towards a base case. Recursion is limited by stack size so when considering the inputs, recursion may not be the right option.


### Leveraging what you know from all experiments conducted this semester, what are slow ways to perform computations?

From the experiments, the pieces that slow the computation contrast those listed in the fast computation paragraph above. The slower data container seems to be the tuple. Tuples are immutable, thus a new one needs to be made each time. The slower for loop is the double-for loop. This requires more iteration. Lastly, the recursive seems to be slower to iterative. The recursive method would be slower since it keeps calling itself and can even run out of room on the AR stack.
