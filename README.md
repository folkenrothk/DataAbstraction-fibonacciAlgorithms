# Fibonacci Algorithms
  _Completed Fall 2021_
  
## Project Instructions

- Use the `cd` command to change into the directory for this repository
- Change into the program directory by typing `cd fibonaccicreator`
- Install the dependencies for the project by typing `poetry install`
- Run the program with one of the algorithms by typing:
  - `poetry run fibonaccicreator --number 10000 --approach iterativetuple`
  - Please note that this is not the only configuration you should try for your experiment
  - Please note that the program will not work unless you add the required source code
  - Please refer to the `writing/reflection.md` file for all ways to run the program
- Confirm that the program is producing the expected output

## Findings

Please refer to [the final report](./writing/reflection) for experiment design and conclusions.
